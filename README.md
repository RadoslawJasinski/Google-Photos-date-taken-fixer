# Google Photos Date Taken Fixer

**Google Photos Date Taken Fixer** is a handy tool designed to restore missing metadata, such as creation date and geolocation, to multimedia files exported from Google Photos via Google Takeout. It ensures your photos and videos retain their original organization and timeline when transferred to other devices, especially iPhones.

## Why Was This Application Created?

When exporting photos and videos from Google Photos using Google Takeout, the exported files often lack essential metadata, such as the creation date and geolocation. This issue causes all files to appear as created on the transfer date when moved to devices like iPhones, disrupting your photo and video organization.

**Google Photos Date Taken Fixer** solves this issue by reading metadata from the JSON files accompanying your exported media and embedding it into the respective multimedia files.
